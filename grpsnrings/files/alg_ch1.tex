\section{Sets, functions and all that}

\defn{Prelimnary definitions}{
\begin{enumerate}
    \item (Cartesian Product): if $A$ and $B$ are non empty sets, the \emph{Cartesian Product} $A \times B$ is defined as the set of ordered pairs $a,b$ wherein $a \in A, b \in B$. i.e, $ A \times B := \{ (a,b): a \in A, b \in B  \}$ 
    \item (Function): A function from $A$ to $B$ is a set $f \subseteq A \times B$ such that, $a,b \in f \text{ and } a,c \in f \implies b=c$. A is called the \textbf{Domain of $f$}. $Range(f):=f(A)$ (see next definition)
    \item (Direct Image): Direct image $f(A):=\{y \in B: \exists x\in A \text{ such that } f(x)=y \}$
    \item (Inverse Image):$f^{-1}(S\subseteq B):=\{x \in A: f(x) \in S\}$
    \item (Relation): Any subset $R\subseteq A \times B$ is a relation from $A$ to $B$.\\We say $x \in X$ is "related to" $y \in Y$ under the relation $R$, or simply $xRy$ or $R(x)=y$ if $(x,y) \in R \subseteq X \times Y$. 
    \item (Injection): $f: A \to B$ is injective if $\forall x_1,x_2 \in A, (x_1,b) \in f \text{ and } (x_2,b) \in f \iff x_1=x_2$
    \item (Surjection): $f:A \to B$ is surjective if $\forall b \in B, \exists a \in A \text{ such that } f(a)=b$
    \item (Bijection): $f:A\to B$ is bijective if its both surjective and injective.
    \item {(Identity function on a set)}: $I_A: A \to A$ defined by $\forall x \in A, I_A(x)=x$
    \item  (Permutation): Simply a bijection from $A$ to itself is called a permutation.
\end{enumerate}
}

\defn{(Left Inverse)}{ We say $f:A \to B$ has a left inverse if there is a function $g: B \to A$ such that $g \circ f=I_A$}
\thmp{}{$f:A \to B$ has a left inverse if and only if it is injective.}{
$\implies$) If $f$ has a left inverse $g$, Consider $x,y \in A$ such that $f(x)=f(y)=p$. 

We have $g \circ f(x)=g(p)=x=g \circ f(y)=y$. Hence, $x=y$, Injective.\\
$\impliedby$) Given that $f:A \to B$ is injective, define $g:B \to A$ as: 
$$
g(z \in B)=
\begin{cases}
a, \text{ where } f(a)=z, \ \text{if } z\in f(A) \\
\text{whatever}, \ \text{if } z \not\in f(A)\end{cases}
$$
consider $g \circ f (x \in A) = g \circ (f(x))$.

Obviously, $f(x) \in f(A)$, therefore, $g(f(x))=$ that $a$ such that $f(a)=f(x)$. 

That $a$ is $x$. 
Hence, $g(f(x))=x$
}
\defn{(Right Inverse)}{$f:A \to B$ is said to have a right inverse if there is a function $g:B \to A$ such that $f \circ g=I_B$}

\thmp{}{$f:A \to B$ has a right inverse if and only if $f$ is Surjective.}
{$\implies$) If $f$ has a right inverse $g$, such that $f \circ g=I_B:B \to B$, then it is evident that the range of $f$ is B, for if not, range of $f \circ g$ wouldn't be $B$ either.\\
$\impliedby$) If $f$ is surjective, then for all $b \in B$, there exists atleast one $a \in A$ such that $f(a)=b$ define $g$ as:
$$g(x \in B)= \text{one of those a} \in A \text{ such that} f(a)=b$$
Consider $f \circ g (x \in B) = f ( \text{ one of the } a \text{ such that } f(a)=b)=b, \forall b \in B$

Hence, $f \circ g=I_B$
}

\thmp{}{If $f$ has left inverse $g_1$ and right inverse $g_2$, then $g_1=g_2$.
\rmk{(True for anything that is Associative, and function composition is associative.)}}{$g_1 \circ f=I_A$ and $f \circ g_2 =I_B$

$g_1 \circ (f \circ g_2)=g_1 \circ I_B= g$

$= (g_1\circ f) \circ g_2=I_A \circ g_2=g_2$

Hence $g_1=g_2$}

\subsection{Operations on Relations}
If $R$ and $S$ are binary relations over $X \times Y$:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $R \bigcup U := \{(x,y) | xRy \text{ or } xSy \}$
  \item $R \bigcap S := \{(x,y) | xRy \text{ and } xSy \}$
  \item Given $S:Y \to Z$ and $R:X \to Y$, $S \circ R:=\{(x,z) | \exists y \text{ such that } ySz \ \& \ xRy \}$
  \item If $R$ is binary over $X \times Y$, $\bar{R} := \{(x,y) | \neg (xRy)\}$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Homogeneous Relations}
If $R$ is a binary relation over $X \times X$, it is Homogeneous.
\defn{Definitions Regarding Relations}{
\begin{enumerate}
  \item (Reflexive): $\forall x \in X, xRx$
  \item (Symmetric): $\forall x,y \in X, xRy \implies yRx$
  \item (Transitive): $\forall x,y,z \in X, \text{ if } xRy \ \& \ yRz \implies xRz$
  \item (Dense): $\forall x,y \in X, \ \text{if} \ xRy, \text{ then there is some } z \in X \text{ such that } xRz \ \& \ zRy$
  \item (\textbf{Equivalence Relation}): $R$ is an equivalence relation if it is Reflexive, Symmetric and Transitive.
  \item (Equivalence class of $a\in A$(where there is an equivalence relation defined)): Set of all $b \in A$ such that $bRa$. 
  \item (Partition of $A$): Any collection of sets $\{A_i :i\in I \}$ (where $I$ is some indexing set) such that: $$A= \bigcup_{i\in I} A_i$$ $$A_i \cap A_j = \phi \text{ if } \forall i,j \in I, i \neq j$$
\end{enumerate}
  }

\thmp{}{Let $A$ be a non-empty set. If $R$ defines an equivalence Relation on $A$, then the set of all equivalence classes of $R$ form a partition of A}{Define our collection $\{ A_{\alpha}\}$ as the set of all equivalence classes of $A$. Clearly, $\bigcup_{\alpha \in I} A_{\alpha}=A$. If $A$ only has one element, obviously, that singleton set makes up the partition. Let $A_{\alpha}$ and $A_{\alpha'}$ be equivalence classes of two elements $a$ and $a'$ in $A$. If $a R a'$, then $A_{\alpha}=A_{\alpha'}$ since every element in the equivalence class of $a$ will, from the transitive property, be in the equivalence class of $a'$ . Suppose $\neg (a R a')$. If, then, $\exists x \in A_{\alpha}$ such that $x\in A_{\alpha'}$, this means that $xR\alpha$ and $xR\alpha'$, but from transitive property, this means $\alpha R\alpha'$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the pairwise intersection is disjoint.}

\thmp{}{If $\{A_i: i \in I \}$ is a partition of A, then there exists an equivalence relation $R$ on $A$ whose equivalence classes are $\{A_i:i \in I\}$.}{ Define $R(x,y)$ if and only if $\exists$ unique $m \in I$ such that $x \in A_m$ and $y \in A_m$.
    

$R(x,x)$ is obvious if non empty, hence $R$ is reflexive.\\\\   
Suppose $R(x,y)$ and $R(y,z)$. Then, there exists a unique $m \in I$ such that $x,y$ are in $A_m$. Similarly, there exists a unique $n \in I$ such that $y,z$ are in $A_n$ . Obviously, if $n \neq m$, intersection of $A_n$ and $A_m$ would be non empty, hence, $n=m$. Hence, $R$ is transitive.\\\\
Consider $R(x,y)$, which means $\exists$ unique $n\in I$ such that $x,y \in A_n \implies R(y,x)$. 
Hence, $R$ is an equivalence relation.}

\thmp{}{Weak Induction $\iff$ Strong Induction.}{$\implies$) Suppose Weak induction is true, but not strong induction. Take our set to be that $S'$ in the negation of the Strong Induction Statement. $S' \neq \mathbb{N}$ implies that, either $1 \not\in S'$ or $\exists k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $k\in S'$ but $k+1 \not\in S'$. We know that $1 \in S'$, so it must be that $\exists k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $k \in S'$ but $k+1 \not\in S'$. $\{1\} \in S' \implies \{1,2\} \in S'$. Assume that for $n$, $\{1,2,..n\} \in S'$. This means that $\{1,2,...n+1\} \in S'$. This means that for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $\{1,2,...n \}\in S' \implies n \in S'$. Contradiction.\\

This means, $n\in S_0 \implies n+1 \in S_0$, which means that $\forall k \in \mathbb{N}, \{1,2,..k\} \in S_0 \implies k+1 \in S_0$. Therefore, $S_0$ is $\mathbb{N}$.}

Does $1$ exist in $S_0$? No, for that will be the least element. Likewise, then, $2$ does not belong in $S_0$. Assume that $\{1,2,...n\} \not\in S_0$. Does $n+1$ exist in $S_0$? No, for that will become the least element then. From Strong Induction, $\mathbb{N}-S_0=\mathbb{N}\implies S_0=\phi$. Contradiction.\\

Suppose on the contrary, $S_0$ is not $\mathbb{N}$. $\mathbb{N}-S_0$ is then, non-empty. From Well Ordering, there is a least element $q \in \mathbb{N}-S_0$. $\implies, q-1 \in S_0$. But this would imply $q-1+1 \in S_0$. Contradiction. $\mathbb{N}-S_0$ is empty.}

\defn{(Finite Sets)}{A set $X$ is said to be finite, with $n$ elements in it, if $\exists n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that there exists a bijection $f: \{1,2..,n\} \to X$. Set $X$ is \emph{infinite} if it is non-finite.}

$$h(i)=\begin{cases}f(i) \text{ if } i=1,2...m\\
g(i-1) \text{ if } i=m+1,m+2,...m+n

If $i=1,2,...m$,$h(i)$ covers all the elements in $A$ through $f$. If $i=m+1,...m+n$, $h(i)$ covers all the elements in $B$ through $g$.

Moreover, $h(i) \neq h(j); i \in [1,m], j\in[m+1,m+n] $ since $A\cap B= \phi$}

\thmp{}{\textbf{Theorem}: Suppose $T$ and $S$ are sets such that $T \subseteq S$. Then:\\

a) If $S$ is finite, $T$ is finite.\\

b)If $T$ is infinite, $S$ is infinite.}{Given that $S$ is finite, there is a function $f:\mathbb{N}_{m} \to S$. Suppose that $S$ has $1$ element. Then either $T$ is empty, or $S$ itself, which means $T$ is finite. Suppose that, upto $n$, it is true that, if $S$ is finite with $n$ elements, all its subsets are finite. Consider $S$ with $n+1$ elements. 

$f:\mathbb{N}_{n+1} \to S$.\\
If $f(n+1) \in T$, consider $T_1:=T-\{f(n+1)\}$
We have $T_1 \subseteq S-\{f(n+1)\}$, and since $S-\{f(n+1)\}$ is a finite set with $n-1$ elements, from induction hypothesis, $T_1$ is finite. Moreover, since $T=T \cup \{f(n+1) \}$, $T$ is also finite with one more element than $T_1$.\\
If $f(n+1) \not\in T$, then $T \subseteq S-\{f(n+1)\}$, we are done.\\\\
(b) is simply the contrapositive of (a).}

\defn{(Countable Sets)}{A set $S$ is said to be \emph{countable},or \emph{denumerable} if, either $S$ is finite, or $\exists f:\mathbb{N} \to S$ which is a bijection. If $S$ is \emph{not countable}, $S$ is said to be \emph{uncountable}}

\thmp{}{The set $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ is countable.}{The number of points on diagonals $1,2,...l$ are: $\psi(k)=1+2+...k=\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$

The point $(m,n)$ occurs on the $(m+n-1$ th diagonal, on which the number $m+n$ is an invariant. The $(m,n)$ point occurs $m$ points down the diagonal. So, to characterise a point, it is enough to specify the diagonal it falls in, and its ordinate (the "rank" of that point on that diagonal). Count the elements till the $m+n-2$nd diagonal, then add $m$, and this would be the position of the point $(m,n)$.\\
Define $r:\mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N} \to  \mathbb{N} $ given by $r(m,n)= \psi(m+n-2)+m$
That this is a bijection is pretty clear because we are counting the position of the point $(m,n)$. For a given point $(m,m)$, there can only be one unique diagnonal on which it exists, and on the diagonal, its rank is unique. Moreover, for every $q \in N$, there corresponds an $(m,n)$ such that $r(m,n)=q$, for, we simply count along each diagonal in the "zig-zag" manner until we reach that $(m,n)$ for which the position is given by $q$. Therefore, $r$ is a bijection. (There are other explicit bijections too)}

\thmp{}{The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $S$ is countable
  \item $\exists$ a surjective function from $\mathbb{N} \to S$
  \item $\exists$ an injective function from $S \to \mathbb{N}$
\end{enumerate}}{($1\implies2)$ is obvious\\
($2\implies3)$ $f:\mathbb{N}\to S$, every element of of $S$ has atleast one preimage in $\mathbb{N}$. Define a function from $S \to \mathbb{N}$ by taking for each $s \in S$ the least such $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $f(n)=s$. This defines an injection.\\
($3\implies1$) If there is an injection from $S \to \mathbb{N}$, then there is a bijection from $S \to $ a subset of $\mathbb{N}$, which implies $S$ is countable.}

\corp{The set of Rational Numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable.}{We know that a surjection from $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{Q}$ exists (where $f(0,0)=0$, and $f(m,n)=\frac{m}{n}$).
We know that $\mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N}$ is bijective to $\mathbb{N}$. This means $\mathbb{N}$ is surjective to $\mathbb{Q}$. We are Done.}

\thmp{}{Every infinite subset of a countable set is countable.}{Consider $N_s \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ which is infinite. 

Define $g(1)=$ least number in $N_s$\\

That it is an injection is obvious, for $g(m)>g(n)$ if $m>n$.\\

Suppose it is not a surjection, i.e, $g(\mathbb{N}) \neq N_s \implies g(\mathbb{N})\subset N_s\implies N_s-g(\mathbb{N}) \neq \phi$\\
Therefore, $N_s-g(\mathbb{N})$ has a least element, $k$. This means that $k-1$ is in $g(\mathbb{N})$. Therefore, there exists $q$ in $\mathbb{N}$ such that $g(q)=k-1$. But then, $g(q+1)$= least number in $N_s$ such that it is bigger than $g(q)$. This would, ofcourse be, $k$, which means $k=g(q+1)$, which puts $k$ in $g(\mathbb{N})$. Contradicton. Hence, $g(\mathbb{N})=N_s$, therefore, $g$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{N} \to N_s$. Since every countable set is bijective to $\mathbb{N}$, and every infinite subset of a countable set is bijective to an infinite subset of $\mathbb{N}$, the theorem holds generally for countable sets.}

\thmp{}{$\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \cdots \mathbb{N}$ is bijective to $\mathbb{N}$}{$\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ is bijective to $\mathbb{N}$ obviously. Assuume that $f:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \cdots \mathbb{N} (\text{ n times })$ is bijective.\\

Suppose $x \in \bigcup_j S_j$, i.e, $x \in S_j$ for some $j$. This means that, $f(n)=x$ for some $n$. Therefore, $k(j,n)=x$. Hence, $k$ is surjective. From theorem 2.14, we are done.\\\\
(\textbf{Remark:}{ Keep in mind, for each $S_j$, there are a myriad of functions $(f_j)_k:\mathbb{N}\to S_j$. For each $S_j$, which is countably infinite, we have to choose one of the many functions that biject $\mathbb{N}$ to $S_j$. So we have a countable collection of sets $C=\{E_j: j\in \mathbb{N}\}$, where $E_j$ denotes the set of all functions that biject $\mathbb{N}$ into $S_j$. So for every element in $C$, we need to choose one element in each element of $C$. This is where the Axiom of Choice comes into play.)}}

\section{Elementary Results regarding Integers}
\defn{}{\begin{enumerate}
\item (Divides) We say $a \in \ZZ \setminus \{0\}$ divides $b \in \ZZ$ if there exists an integer $\delta$ such that $a\delta=b$. We denote it by $a|b$.
\item (GCD) We call a number $d$ the "Greatest Common Divisor" of two integers $a$ and $b$ if $d|a$ and $d|b$, and $d$ is the largest such number that divides both $a$ and $b$ (that the largest such number exists is clear, since divisors are finite).
\item (LCM) We call a number $l$ the "Least Common Multiple" of two integers $a$ and $b$ if $a|l$ and $b|l$ and $l$ is the smallest such integer. 
\end{enumerate}}

\defn{Prime Number}{A number $p$ in $\NN$ is \emph{prime} if it has only itself and $1$ as divisors. Non-primes are called composite. }

\thmp{}{\begin{enumerate}
\item The GCD $d$ of $a,b \in \ZZ$ is unique, and has the property that, if any other integer $q$ is a divisor of $a$ and $b$, then $q$ divides $d$.
\item The LCM $l$ of $a,b \in \ZZ$ is unique, and has the property that, if another integer $p$ is a multiple of $a$ and $b$, then $l$ divides $p$.
\item If LCM of $a,b$ and GCD of $a,b$ are $l$ and $d$ respectively, then $dl=ab$.
\end{enumerate}}{(1) This will be proved below with the division algorithm. For now note that, if every divisor divides $d$, then $d$ is the GCD.
\\\\(2) This is also proved using the divison algorithm. For now note that if every multiple of $a,b$ is divisible by a multiple $l$, then it is the least common multiple.
\\\\(3) Suppose $d$ is the unique GCD of $a,b$ and $l$ is the unique LCM of $a,b$.\\\\
Note that $d|ab$ which means $dc_0=ab$ for some $c_0$.
$c_0=a(\frac{b}{d})$ and $c_0=b(\frac{a}{d})$. This means $c_0$
is a multiple of $a$ and $b$ which means $l|c_0$. We have
$lq_0=c_0$ for some $q_0$. This means $dlq_0=dc_0=ab$.
$(dq_0)(\frac{l}{a})=b$ and $(dq_0)(\frac{l}{b})=a$ which 
makes $dq_0$ a divisor. This would necessarily mean $q_0=1$, whence, we are done.

\subsection{Euclid's Divison Algorithm}
\lemp{The Lemma}{Given integers $a,b \in \ZZ$ with $b \neq 0$, we get a unique $q \in \ZZ$ and $r\in \ZZ$ such that:
$$a=bq+r$$ with $0 \leq r<|b|$.
}{We Prove for the case that $a,b \in \NN$. Assume that for $a_0 \in \NN$, the divison lemma works, 
i.e, $\exists q_0$ and $r_0$ so that $$a_0=bq_0+r_0$$ with $0\leq r<|b|$.
Look at $a_0+1=bq_0+r_0+1$. We have that, either $r_0+1=b$, or $r_0+1<b$. If its the former,
then we see that $a_0+1=bq_0+b=b(q_0+1)+0$ whence we see that the new quotient is $q_0+1$ and the new remainder is $0$.
Hence, by induction, the lemma is proved.\\\\
For the cases where $a<0$ or $b<0$, we can simply multiply by $-1$ to get the result.
}
\textbf{The Algorithm:}
\\\\ We start with $a,b \in \ZZ \setminus \{ 0\}$, and without loss of 
generality, we assume that $a\geq b$. We then have:

$$\centering{a=bq_0+r_0} \text{ with } 0 \leq r_0<|b|$$
$$\centering{b=r_0q_1+r_1} \text{ with } 0 \leq r_1<r_0<|b|$$
$$\centering{r_0=r_1q_2+r_2} \text{ with } 0 \leq r_2<r_1<r_0<|b|$$
$$\centering{r_1=r_2q_3+r_3} \text{ with } 0 \leq r_3<r_2<r_1<r_0<|b|$$
$$\vdots$$
$$r_{n_0-1}=r_{n_0}q_{n_0+1}+r_{n_0+1} \text{ with } 0 \leq r_{n_0+1}<r_{n_0} \cdots b $$
$$r_{n_0}=r_{n_0+1}q_{n_0+2}+r_{n_0+2} \text{ with } 0 \leq r_{n_0+2}<r_{n_0+1} \cdots <b$$
Since we cannot have a sequence of strictly decreasing positive integers, we note that at some point, $r_{n}=0(=r_{n_0+2} \text{ for our sake})$. 

We would then have (in the last step), $$r_{n_0}=r_{n_0+1}q_{n_0+2}+0$$ and back substituting,
$$r_{n_0-1}=r_{n_0+1}(q_{n_0+2}q_{n_0+1}+1)$$
$$r_{n_0-2}=(r_{n_0+1}(q_{n_0+2}q_{n_0+1}+1))q_{n_0}+r_{n_0+1}q_{n_0+2} $$
And finally we would end up with $$a=r_{n_0+1}(\text{something}_1) $$
and $$b=r_{n_0+1}(\text{something}_2) $$ with the added fact that $r_{n_0+1}$ divides every remainder $r_n$ in the division algorithm performed with $a$ and $b$. 
\\\\ \textbf{Proof that any divisor divides the GCD:} Suppose that $z$ is a divisor of $a$ and $b$. 
From $a=bq_0+r_0$, and $$\frac{a}{z}=\frac{b}{z}q_0+\frac{r_0}{z} $$
we see that $z$ divides $r_0$. From $b=r_0q_1+r_1$ and $$\frac{b}{z}=\frac{r_0}{z}q_1+\frac{r_1}{z} $$
we see that $z$ divides $r_1$ too. Suppose $z$ divides all remainders till $r_{n_0}$. $r_{n_0-1}=r_{n_0}q_{n_0+1}+r_{n_0+1}$
gives us $\frac{r_{n_0-1}}{z}=\frac{r_{n_0}}{z}q_{n_0+1} +\frac{r_{n_0+1}}{z}$ whence we see that $r_{n_0+1}$ is 
divisible by $z$. Therefore, $r_{n_0+1}$ is the GCD.
\\\\ \textbf{Proof that any multiple is divisible by LCM:} Suppose that $l$ and $m$ are multiples of $a,b$ and $l$ is the least such multiple.
Then $l \leq m$ with equality case being trivial. Suppose $l<m$. From Euclid's division lemma, we have $m=lq_0+r_0$ with $0<r_0<l<m$. Both $a$ and $b$ divide $m$ and $l$, which means
$$\frac{m}{a}=\frac{l}{a}q_0+\frac{r_0}{a}$$ and $$\frac{m}{a}=\frac{l}{a}q_0+\frac{r_0}{a}$$ Which makes $r_0$ a multiple of $a$ and $b$, which is absurd.
\thmp{Bezout's Theorem}{If $a,b \in \ZZ\setminus \{0\}$, then there exists $x,y \in \ZZ$ so that gcd($a,b$)
=$xa+yb$}{From the first equation we see $$ a=bq_0+r_0 \implies r_0=a-bq_0$$
putting $r_0$ in the 2nd equation we see: $$b=(a-bq_0)q_1+r_1 \implies r_1= b-(a-bq_0)q_1$$
Putting $r_1$ and $r_0$ into the 3rd equation, we get, likewise, $r_2$ in terms of $a$ and $b$ (a linear combination of $a$ and $b$)
As such, we can keep doing this to express $r_{n_0+1}$ as a linear combination of $a$ and $b$, like, $xa+yb$.}

\thmp{Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic}{Given an integer $a>1$, we can decompose $a$ as a product of primes uniquely (upto ordering)}{If $a=2$, obviously we can. Suppose we can decompose every positive integer $q$ $1<q<n_0$ as a product of primes. Consider $n_0+1=p_1^{\alpha_1}p_2^{\alpha_2}\cdots p_n^{\alpha_n}+1$. Either $p_1^{\alpha_1}p_2^{\alpha_2}\cdots p_n^{\alpha_n}+1$
is a prime or is composite. If it is prime, we are done. If it is a composite number, then $p_1^{\alpha_1}p_2^{\alpha_2}\cdots p_n^{\alpha_n}+1=xy$ where $x$ and $y$ are numbers smaller than $n_0+1$.
But since $x$ and $y$ can be expressed as a product of primes, we see that $n_0+1$ can also be represented as a product of primes.
\\\\ Suppose $a=p_1^{\alpha_1}p_2^{\alpha_2}\cdots p_n^{\alpha_n}$, but also $a=p_1^{\alpha'_1}p_2^{\alpha'_2}\cdots p_m^{\alpha'_m}$.
\\ We have ($m\geq n$): $$1=p_1^{\alpha_1-\alpha'_1}p_2^{\alpha_2-\alpha'_2} \cdots p_n^{\alpha_n-\alpha'_n} p_{n+1}^{-\alpha'_{n+1}} \cdots p_m^{-\alpha'_m}$$
$$1=p_1^{\alpha'_1-\alpha_1}p_2^{\alpha'_2-\alpha_2} \cdots p_n^{\alpha'_n-\alpha_n} p_{n+1}^{\alpha'_{n+1}} \cdots p_m^{\alpha'_m}$$
Obviously, not all $\alpha_j-\alpha'_j$ are positive, in the same way they all aren't negative. Suppose some of these
powers are positive, while some negative. Consider some $p_j^{\delta_j}$ for which the power is negative, which moves it to the denominator.
We have: $$1=\frac{\text{some primes raised to negative}\cdot {\text{ some primes raised to positive} }}{p_j^{\delta_j}}$$
If we multiply the negative powers out to both sides, we get to a stage where we see that $p_j$ divides a product of primes (raised to positive powers).
But, $p_j$ is different from all the primes, and hence does not divide any of them individually, which means,
from the lemma(s) below, that $p_j$ actually does not divide the whole product. A contradiction. Hence, the only case remaining is that of
product of primes raised to $0$ powers, which makes it unique.

$$\textbf{Requisite Lemmas:}$$ 
\\\\Lemma: Suppose $m$ is such that gcd($a,m$)$=1$, and $|ab$. Then, we have that $m|b$.
\\ To see this, we use Bezout's Theorem: there exists $x$ and $y$ integers such that $ax+my=1$.
This means $abx+mby=b \implies \frac{ab}{m}x+by=\frac{b}{m}$ whence it becomes clear.
\\\\Lemma: If a prime $p$ divides $z^n$ for some integer $z$ and some natural $n$, then $p$ divides $z$.
\\ To see this, Suppose that $p$ does not divide $z$. Which means, from the lemma above, that 
$p$ divides $z^{n-1}$, which likewise means it divides $z^{n-2}$ and finally reaching to a contradiction that
it finally divides $z$.
}
If we arrange the primes $p_1,p_2,\cdots p_n$ in ascending order, we find that this representation becomes the only one (no order permutations).
\\\\\textbf{AN ALTERNATE LOOK AT GCD AND LCM:}
\\\\ Suppose that $a=p_1^{q_1} p_2^{q_2}\cdots p_n^{q_n}$ and $b=p_1^{r_1} p_2^{r_2} \cdots p_n^{r_n}\cdots p_m^{r_m}$. Since all numbers whatsoever are
product of primes, we have that every divisor is of the form (for a number $z=p_1^{l_1}p_2^{l_2}\cdots p_k^{l_k}$) $p_1^{j_1}p_2^{j_2}\cdots p_k^{j_k}$
with $j_1\leq l_1, j_2\leq l_2 \cdots j_k \leq l_k$. The number of divisors for a given $z=p_1^{l_1}p_2^{l_2}\cdots p_k^{l_k}$ would therefore be:
${(l_1+1)\choose{1}} {(l_2+1)\choose{1}} \cdots {(l_k+1)\choose{1}}$.
\\\\ We note that, given $a=p_1^{x_1}p_2^{x_2}\cdots p_m^{x_m}$ and $b=p_1^{y_1}p_2^{y_2}\cdots p_m^{y_m}$ with $x_j, y_j \geq 0$,
$$gcd(a,b)=p_1^{min(x_1,y_1)}p_2^{min(x_2,y_2)} \cdots p_m^{min(x_m,y_m)} $$
and 
$$lcm(a,b)=p_1^{max(x_1,y_1)}p_2^{max(x_2,y_2)} \cdots p_m^{max(x_m,y_m)} $$
\\\\ \textbf{Euler Totient Function ($\phi$):}
\\\\ The Euler Totient function $\phi$ is defined as follows:
$$\phi(n)=\text{ number of positive integers } z \text{ less than or equal to } n \text{ such that } gcd(n,z)=1 $$
For primes $p$, every number smaller than $p$ is coprime to $p$, hence $\phi(p)=p-1$
More generally we have for primes $p$ and natural $q$, 
$\phi(p^q)=p^q-p^{q-1}$.
